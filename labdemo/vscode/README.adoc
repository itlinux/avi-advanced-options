| X-Avi-Version |*YES* |  API version to use for the API call. Avi controller supports all the API version which is less than equal to the version of the Controller. In order to use a feature that is released in a version, eg. 17.2.7, the API version should be greater than or equal to 17.2.7. It is important to remember that API version determines the version of the API data.

=== ENV File
The env file is allowing us to store password, and other variables we will use in our http code. This will allow us to show our codes without showing the sensitive data. Furthermore, you can have multiple location, just use diff variable names to achieve that. The example has that already.
